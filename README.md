# Python_PokeDex

I've created a Python Pokedex using the data provided from PokeAPI. If you like the project or have any suggesstions, feel free to let me know. This is my first project working on API fetching, and json parsing in Python aha, hope you like it. I had some fun working on the background images in photoshop, and the tkinter Graphical user interface. 

To execute the file, please run the main.py file. You do need to have Python 3.8 installed and the pip libraries used in the .py file.
