The DATA folder contains .json information for all the pokemon you've searched for.
Within the sub folders for each pokemon, you will find a .png illistrating their skills in a pie graph matplotlib photo.
I hope you enjoyed this project, It's the first one i've worked on by myself involving API fetching, and json libraries.
If you have any suggesstions feel free to let me know, and i can implement them into the project!
